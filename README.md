# Synopsys R&D internship-Gayathri Swetha

I am a recent undergarduate B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras (Graduated in 2025) with a strong foundation in **Digital Design, Computer Architecture, and Hardware Description Languages**.  
I have hands-on experience designing, implementing, and verifying digital systems at both the RTL and physical levels, including high-performance multipliers, asynchronous FIFOs, and pipelined MAC units.  

I enjoy taking on challenging hardware problems and figuring out how to make designs faster, more efficient, and more reliable. This internship would give me the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers while contributing my skills in digital design and verification to meaningful projects.I’m committed to delivering quality results while learning and improving every day.

## Relevant Projects
### 1. Asynchronous FIFO for Cross-Clock Domain Transfer
16×8 FIFO in Verilog with modular memory, Gray code pointers, and D flip-flop synchronizers for reliable cross-domain transfer. Verified with Verilog testbench.

### 2. Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) Module
BlueSpec System Verilog design supporting integer and IEEE 754 floating-point operations without + or *. Verified using Cocotb with IEEE 754 rounding compliance.

### 3. 8×8 Unsigned Multiplier – Dadda Tree
Designed and implemented an 8x8 unsigned multiplier using Dadda tree architecture using 22nm CMOS Technology node and verified design with DRC/LVS clean layout and simulated waveforms.Implemented the vector merge using a high-performance adder, optimizing for speed and reducing delay. 

### 4. In-Memory Compute Engine
