# synopsys-rnd-internship-gayathri-swetha

I am a final-year B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras (Graduating 2025) with a strong foundation in **Digital Design, Computer Architecture, and Hardware Description Languages**.  
I have hands-on experience designing, implementing, and verifying digital systems at both the RTL and physical levels, including high-performance multipliers, asynchronous FIFOs, and pipelined MAC units.  

I am passionate about solving complex hardware problems, optimizing for performance and efficiency, and contributing to innovative R&D projects.
